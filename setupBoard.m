function Ships = setupBoard()
% DON'T UPDATE THIS FUNCTION, JUST USE IT!
% Determines the RANDOM placement of the 5 ships that are part of the
% battleship game within the 10x10 gameboard.  The function will return a
% matrix where the 1st column of each row specifies the ship based on the
% list below, the second column specifies the direction (1 = vertical,
% 2 = horizontal), and the third and fourth columns specify the starting
% coordinate of the ship. Here are the ships types and their length
%                     Type#     Length
%   Aircraft Carrier    1       5
%   Battleship          2       4
%   Submarine           3       3
%   Cruiser             4       3
%   PT Boat             5       2
%
%   Example-row 1 of Ships is: [2 1 4 5] --> specifies that the Battlehsip
%   is placed vertically starting at position row 4, col 5 and would thus
%   occupy the following coordinates: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5).
%
%   Here is are one possible RANDOM outputs from this function, note that
%   the Aircraft Carrier (i.e. id ship 1) is placed horizontally (2) at
%   position row 1 and column 1.
